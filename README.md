## About Me

I am a **Marine Corps veteran** and **AWS employee** with a passion for building robust, scalable, and intelligent systems. As the founder of **MADPANDA3D**, I operate as a solo developer supercharged by a team of AI agents, allowing me to architect and deliver enterprise-grade applications with the speed and agility of a startup. My background as an Aircraft Firefighter instilled a mission-critical discipline that I apply to every project, ensuring reliability and performance from the ground up.

My unique development approach combines deep technical expertise with a powerful AI-assisted workflow, enabling me to tackle complex challenges across the full stack—from crafting pixel-perfect frontends to deploying and managing production infrastructure.

## Core Capabilities

My work focuses on transforming complex business needs into functional, high-performance software. I specialize in building not just applications, but entire operational systems that are automated, intelligent, and ready for production.

*   **Production-Grade SaaS & Web Applications:** I build end-to-end, full-stack applications with a focus on clean user experience, robust backends, and seamless deployment. My flagship project, a SaaS platform for trading card collectors, has undergone over 100 release cycles, demonstrating a commitment to iterative improvement and long-term stability.

*   **AI & Automation Infrastructure:** I architect and deploy the backbone for modern AI systems. This includes creating a comprehensive ecosystem of **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** that provide a stable, tool-rich environment for AI agents to perform complex tasks. My work in this area includes production-hosted services for vector database management, media processing, and enterprise API integration.

*   **Enterprise API Integration & DevOps:** I have extensive experience integrating with and abstracting complex third-party APIs, such as GoHighLevel (269+ tools) and Discord. I containerize these solutions with Docker, manage them with Nginx, and deploy them to production VPS environments, ensuring they are monitored, secure, and scalable.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my ability to deliver complete, production-ready systems.

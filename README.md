## 🌟 About Me

I'm **Leo Lara**, founder and CEO of **MADPANDA3D** and the architect behind production systems that blend AI, automation, and full-stack engineering. As a **Marine Corps veteran**, I bring mission-critical discipline to every project. I built my career in Telecom—specializing in networking and break-fix repair—and now operate as a **solo developer supercharged by AI agents**, delivering enterprise-grade applications with the speed and agility of a startup. Currently pursuing **Cybersecurity studies** to deepen my expertise in secure system design. I'm from Hollywood, FL, and some of my passions include designing systems that solve real-world problems and helping veterans in any way I can.

My unique development approach combines deep technical expertise with a powerful AI-assisted workflow, enabling me to architect and deliver complete, production-ready systems across the full stack—from pixel-perfect React frontends to Docker-deployed infrastructure with live hosted endpoints.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

When I'm not coding, I'm building networks and working on my **home cloud infrastructure**—over **180TB of storage** ready to handle anything I throw at it 🖥️💾. Because why rent cloud storage when you can build your own datacenter? 🚀
